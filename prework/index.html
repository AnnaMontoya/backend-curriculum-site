    <p>
      Welcome to Turing! Your pre-work is broken up into a few different sections. Start off with the first week's suggested schedule. Once you've completed everything in the first week's schedule, move on to the Next Steps. If you still have time and would like to learn more, you may move on to the Extend Your Learning section. Before coming to Turing, please remember to complete Task G, the Pre-Work Reflection.

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their early weeks with us.

    <h3>Your Time at Turing</h3>
    <p>
      If you haven't heard already, Turing is a fast-paced learning environment. Our goal is to prepare you to be a successful, employable web developer by the end of your 4th module. Being as fast paced as it is, the prework is essential to prepare you for your learning at Turing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turing isn't just about learning to code. We want to prepare you technically and in professional skills, which includes supporting Turing's mission and vision:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.turing.io/">
      Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>What is Back-End Development?</h3>
    <p>
      Modern software, and web software especially, is driven by content – without the content, most of it wouldn’t be worth bothering with. And all of that content has to live somewhere. It needs to be stored, retrieved, manipulated, formatted, etc. etc. When we talk about “back-end” programming, we’re often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making this possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storing data and accessing it later</li>
      <li>Verifying that data is accurate</li>
      <li>Manipulating and analyzing data</li>
      <li>Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The “front-end” is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The “back-end” typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, authenticating users, etc.; it’s what happens behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="learning_goals">Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>
      The prework below is intended to take you 7 days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you plan to spend 14 days on this 7-day prework, you should break up the work so that you are doing work and coding every day, even if it is only a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)</li>
      <li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
      <li>Become familiar with some common terminology used in web development</li>
      <li>Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple game (for show and tell)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the <strong>Next Steps</strong> section that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to use as a deeper dive.</p>
    <p>Remember, don't worry if you don't understand 100% of everything. Let's get started!</p>

    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <p>Here are the items you will need to complete the prework:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A computer - preferably a laptop running Mac OSX that is a 2013 model or newer</li>
    </ul>

          <p>If this is your first time using a Mac instead of a PC or Linux, then watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN0FD8KW2V4" target="_blank">this video</a> about using a Mac.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Daily Warm Up</h4>
          <p>Work through <a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a> and <a href="https://brilliant.org/computer-science/computer-science/?subtopic=types-and-data-structures" target="_blank">Algorithmic thinking and logic</a> as described in <a href="#daily">Daily Warm Up</a>.</p>

        <li>
          <h4>Setting up your Environment</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>If you are a Mac user: </strong>follow the directions listed <a href="environment_setup_prework" target="_blank">here</a> to get your computer set up for Turing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If you are a Windows user:</strong> Ruby is trickier to set up on Windows machines. In addition, the commands you'll be using on a Mac while at Turing will be different. In order to get started on a Windows machine, you'll complete the prework using the [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) online IDE by following the instructions below:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Click "Try it Now"</li>
            <li>Fill in username, email, and password</li>
            <li>Click "Create your free account"</li>
            <li>Click "Go to your dashboard"</li>
            <li>Click "Create a new workspace"</li>
            <li>In "Workspace name", type "turing-prework"</li>
            <li>Don't fill in or select anything else; just click "Create workspace" at the bottom</li>
            <li>Wait for your workspace to load </li>
            <li>The navy blue box at the bottom is your command line (referred to as "Terminal" in some reference materials). The sidebar on the left-hand side is your file tree. The area in the middle is your text editor. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Start learning to use the command line in terminal.</h4>
          <p>Watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/152746852" target="_blank">this video</a>.<br><br>Read AND start <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line" target="_blank">these</a> exercises   <br></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Start a Gist to Track Your Prework Progress</h4>
          <p>
            Create a public GitHub Gist where you will keep track of your pre-work progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            A gist is basically a file where you can add text, and the file is tied to your GitHub account. Here is some <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/" target="_blank">more information about gists</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is some documentation about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/" target="_blank">how to create a gist</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From your GitHub account, create a public gist with the filename that includes the word "prework" and your name. Something like: <code>JimSmith_Prework.md</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>.md</code> file extension for your gist refers to markdown formatting. Markdown is a simple markup language to help format your text. For example, you can add a heading in markdown using the hash: <code># This is my main heading</code>. <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">This article</a> shows everything you need for basic markdown formatting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> When adding images to your Gist, make sure they are saved as a .jpg or a .png file.
          </p>

            <li>What does pwd stand for, and how is this command helpful?</li>
            <li>What does ls do? What about cd and mkdir?</li>
            <li>What does hostname tell you, and what shows up in YOUR terminal when you type hostname?</li>
            <li>
              Type the following commands into your Terminal to ensure you have Ruby, rbenv and Git installed. Take a screenshot that shows the versions of each of these, and post it as a comment in your Gist:
              <ul>
                <li>which ruby</li>
                <li>git --version</li>
