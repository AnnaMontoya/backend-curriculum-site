## Learning Goals

- Students can define basic React vocabulary (Component, JSX, Prop, State)
- Students are able to create and use React components with heavy guidance from samples and documentation

## Warm Up

* What do you know thus far about React?
* Why do front-end frameworks / libraries exist?
* What are the different types of variables you can define in JS? What's the scope of variables in JS land?

## Background

Let's quickly refresh on the history of JavaScript and front-end development.

### Refresher -- Front-End Application History

*   Beginning: Basic jQuery scripting; mostly static HTML
with small bits of dynamism on top of them
*   Mostly ad-hoc / isolated interactions with the server
*   __Problems:__ Browser applications becoming more and more
complex; numerous DOM Elements dependent on dynamic
data coming from servers or other sources
*   __Frameworks:__ Like many technical problems, the open source community
decided to solve this with more robust and sophisticated
libraries

### The Landscape - Front-End Application Architectures

As front-end frameworks have proliferated, lots of different
ideas and approaches have been attempted, and we can
place them across a few interesting continua:

*   Small libraries vs. large frameworks
*   View and interaction only vs. data and persistence management
*   View/data combination vs. view/data separation

## React's Take

Part of the fundamental problem is that as the number of UI elements
we're dealing with grows, the complexity of keeping them up to date
and in sync with all the relevant data grows as well.

Imagine you were developing a modern video-game: You likely have numerous
in-game "objects" that interact with one another as well as with the
game's landscape and environment, and ultimately all of these are getting
rendered onto a high resolution screen that could easily have millions of
pixels.

Suppose the player flips a switch in the game causing a light to turn on
somewhere in the environment. How do you handle updating the screen?
Do you seek out all the specific pixels which correspond to the light
and turn them on individually?

Probably not! But this is, in many ways, how front-end web technologies
have handled the problem of updating Browser-based User Interfaces in
response to user interactions.

Clicked a button? Hold on, let me find the DOM element which corresponds
to the button you clicked and update its color.

Clicked a dropdown? Hold on, let me find the (currently hidden) chunk of
HTML which is associated with it and toggle it on.

And this is not to say that front-end developers are incompetent --
there are many reasons for doing things this way:

*   it's relatively intuitive
*   for much of the web's history, the amount of interactive elements
we've dealt with on a page were small and easy to track
*   it minimizes expensive DOM re-renders (more on this in a moment)

### What's the Alternative?

Think back to our video game example: we gave one example of
something we probably _wouldn't_ do. So how _would_ we handle
the situation?

As an alternative to trying to selectively re-draw portions
of the scene, we could take a more whole-hog approach: Just
re-draw everything.

Consider the benefits of this approach:

*   Conceptually simpler: rendered scene is simply a product
of all the existing information about the world's state
*   Conceptually consistent: every re-render follows the same process
(initial render is no different than subsequent updates)

Also consider the costs:

*   More computationally intensive (more rendering being done); likely
to run into performance issues

### What it Means for Web Development

In practice, this last difficulty has largely prevented
this approach from taking off in web development.

One of the perennial thorns in the side of browser developers
is the speed of updating the DOM. Whenever we want to, say,
add a CSS class to an element, the browser has to go through
an extensive "re-painting" process. With sufficient
numbers of DOM elements, this process can get slow enough
for the UI to feel sluggish and unusable.

By avoiding large swaths of updates (i.e. with the traditional
approach of updating small chunks of markup at a time), we
can avoid this problem and keep our browser-based
UI's snappy.

### Where Does React Come In?

React's big innovation is that it gives us a way to utilize
the "re-render the world" approach in the context of DOM manipulation.

Using React, we'll define __components__ -- individual pieces of our UI
in terms of the pieces of data they depend on. Then, we'll give each
component a key __render__ function, which tells React how to
re-generate the portion of the DOM controlled by that component
_in terms of its data._

Then, whenever anything changes, React can walk down the component tree,
re-rendering components in terms of their associated data (which may or may not have changed).

But what about the performance problems of DOM repaints?

React gets around this problem by implementing a separate, in-memory model
of the current DOM (called a "virtual DOM"). When things need to be re-rendered,
it can (very quickly) re-generate its virtual representation of the DOM. Then,
it actually uses an algorithm to isolate those elements that _actually changed_,
and sends real DOM updates to only those elements.

So when we said React allows us to continuously re-render the entire UI in response
to data changes, we were oversimplifying. In reality, React itself does end up
sending selective updates to the DOM.

However its internal implementation (using
a virtual representation of the DOM and a diffing algorithm) allows us, the developer,
to write our code as if the top-to-bottom re-render was actually occurring.

While the idea of a "virtual DOM" is an interesting and important implementation
detail, the fundamental shift toward a more functional and less imperative model
of UI programming is ultimately what makes React so interesting.

### Other Benefits of React

*   __Lightweight__ -- does a specific thing and does it pretty well
*   __Very modular__ -- easy to drop in for a small portion
of your UI without having to rewrite everything in React
*   __Easy to learn__ -- As we will see shortly, there's
not much to it. Learn the basics for setting up components
as well as a few core lifecycle methods, and you're ready to start
building your own UI.

## Discussion

Now that you've had a little introduction into React, discuss the following with your partner:

- What parts of Quantified Self could have been easier with React?
- When do you think you would use React? What is not a good use case for React?

And then let's come back as a group and report out your answers.

#### Quick Aside: JSX

A big trait of React that is worth mentioning is its use of JSX vs plain old JavaScript. JSX itself exists as a statically-typed spin-off of JavaScript that can be used on its own outside of React. However, you'll likely mostly encounter it within React apps.

JSX

- is a syntax extension of JavaScript
- is statically-typed, but can infer the type set to variables based on their initial declaration
- integrates HTML within JavaScript
  - this means that most elements and DOM manipulation in React will happen through JS (you will barely touch `index.html`)
- can be typed within `.js` files within React, but `.jsx` extensions can also be used
  - if using `.jsx`, remember to tack that extension onto the end of the file you're importing

Read more about its use in React [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

## Likes Counter Code Along

We ultimately want to create something like this:

![](/assets/images/lessons/react-in-theory/final-image.png)

Let's break this up so we can develop individual components.

If you were dividing this UI into sections, what would your sections be?

### Install Some Tools

Install the [react dev tools]( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en). It will give you additional information about your React application in the Chrome dev tools.

Then we're going to use a tool from Facebook called [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It configures webpack and babel for us, so we don't need to worry about them and can focus on React.

Some terminal commands:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app awesome-counter
cd awesome-counter
npm start
```

Let's navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

Look at that - we have our React dev environment set up!

### Explore the app

Open a new tab in Terminal and open up your project with your text editor.

Open `./src/App.js`

Let's walk through this...

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

First we import React and specifically the Component class from React. We can also import images, svg files and css. Then we define our main `App` component / module.

How does our App component get added to our view?

Open your `./index.js` file.

ReactDOM is React's object for interacting with the DOM. You can see we create an instance of our `<App />` and add it to our root element which can be found in our `public/index.html` page.

#### Capitalized React Component Convention

Take note of how `<App />` is capitalized.

From the [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html):

> Capitalized types indicate that the JSX tag is referring to a React component. These tags get compiled into a direct reference to the named variable, so if you use the JSX <Foo /> expression, Foo must be in scope.
> When an element type starts with a lowercase letter, it refers to a built-in component like <div> or <span> and results in a string 'div' or 'span' passed to React.createElement. Types that start with a capital letter like <Foo /> compile to React.createElement(Foo) and correspond to a component defined or imported in your JavaScript file.
> We recommend naming components with a capital letter. If you do have a component that starts with a lowercase letter, assign it to a capitalized variable before using it in JSX.

### Time to Make a New Component!

Let's start by creating the template for the Like / Dislike button. Create an `ActionButton` class above our `App` class in `index.js`:

```jsx
class ActionButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button className="action-button">
        Submit
      </button>
    )
  }
}

...

class App extends Component {
  ...
}
```

Let's add the new component to our `App` component. Replace everything inside the `App` `div` with the `ActionButton` component:

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <ActionButton />
</div>
```

Head back to your browser. Great, we have our button! Open up the console, click on the React tab, Expand the `<App>` component and you'll see we have our `<ActionButton />` component. Take a minute to dig in and see what comes up in our sidebar.

```
Props
  Empty Object
```

### Props

Props are crucial attributes of React components. A `prop` is an immutable property that holds data to be passed down to the component.

Right now the text within our button is hardcoded to be 'Submit'; let's change it to be dynamic via props.

```jsx
class ActionButton extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <button className="actionButton">
        {this.props.text}
      </button>
    )
  }
}
```

Now, let's pass our text into our instantiation of our `ActionButton`.

`<ActionButton text="Submit"/>`

Check out your React dev tools again. Select the `<ActionButton />`, what do you see under props?

Note that the word `text` here is completely arbitrary. It can be whatever you want to refer to that value as in your component. We could have put `<ActionButton jellyfish="Submit"/>` and within our JSX, accessed `{this.props.jellyfish}`.

### Refactor (3-5 minutes)

Work with a partner to refactor your `ActionButton` component out of `App.js.` I'd recommend you create a `components` directory within `src` to start housing these components in.

### Action Time

Currently, our button does not do anything. Let's add an action. Add an `onClick` property to your button element.

```jsx
<button
    className="actionButton"
    onClick={() => alert(this.props.text)}>

  {this.props.text}
</button>
```

Cool, now let's make our button a more customizable by passing in our action.

First, modify your `ActionButton`'s `render` function.

```jsx
<button
    className="actionButton"
    onClick={this.props.onClick}>

  {this.props.text}
</button>
```

Inside your `App.js` file, pass in a function to your instantiated `ActionButton`.

```jsx
<ActionButton
    text="Submit"
    onClick={this.handleClick}/>
```

Finally, add a `handleClick` function to your `App` component.

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    alert('you clicked me!')
  }
  render() {...}
}
```

### Synthesize: Passing Actions as Props

You might be wondering why we're passing a `handleClick` function as a prop from `App` to our child component, `ActionButton`.

We absolutely could be defining this method within `ActionButton`, but if we're learning it this way, there's got to be a benefit (trust us).

#### "Data Down, Actions Up"

Components in React can pass information down to their children, but there isn't really a way for children to pass data back up to the parent. This is because the parent knows about the child (because it's in the render function), but the child component doesn't have any way to access its parent.

The convention the React community (and Ember community before them) has adopted is passing actions down as data and allowing them to bubble back up.

Just remember: **data down, actions up**

In our app, since the action handler is defined as a method of its parent component, it has access to everything that the parent component has access to. As long as the child component uses the handler that was passed down, the parent is the one who is actually handling the action.

Read more about how this works in React [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lifting-state-up.html).

### Build our View (15-20 minutes)

Let's create a new component called `LikesCounter`. This component should have two `ActionButton`s: one saying "Like" and one saying "Dislike". When you click "Like" or "Dislike", an alert of which one was clicked should appear. Build this component in a new file, `components/LikesCounter.js`

After you create your `LikesCounter`, replace the `ActionButton` in your `App` with a `LikesCounter`.

Anticipate the following error:

```
Error in ./src/LikesCounter.js
Syntax error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag
```

This is important. React components can only render one _root level_ element, which simply means that you have to structure your JSX so that everything is contained within a single element.

Let's fix this by wrapping our adjacent `ActionButton` components in a `div`.

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <ActionButton
      text="Like +1"
    />
    <ActionButton
      text="Dislike -1"
    />
  </div>
)
```

### Props vs State

Now that our HTML is in place, it's time to add some behavior to the buttons.

Let's about what we're trying to accomplish here:

When the page loads, we want the initial value of Likes to be 0. Then when we click "Like", we want to add 1 to the value of Likes, and remove 1 when we click "Dislike".

Let's rephrase. On page load we want to set the *initial* state of our `LikesCounter` to have a count of 0, in other words we want to "initialize" our component to have some values. Sounds like a constructor!

Along with sending the `props` through our custom HTML element, we can also define an initial `state` on our components that can be mutated based on user interaction and changes to our data.

From [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html):

> State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

Our state machine needs to get that information from somewhere, so let's start with passing in an `initialLikes` property to our `<LikesCounter />` instance:

`<LikesCounter initialLikes="0" />`

Now we can add a constructor to our `LikesCounter` component. In our constructor, we will set the initial state of our component.

Underneath the class declaration for `LikesCounter`, let's add our constructor function.

A standard component's constructor function takes `props` as an argument and calls `super(props)`. In an ES6 child class constructor, `this` cannot be used until `super` is called.

```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props)
  this.state = {
    likes: props.initialLikes
  }
}
```

We can now access a dynamically changing `likes` state value within our LikesCounter as so:

```jsx
render() {
  return(
    <div>
      <p>Likes: {this.state.likes}</p>
    ...
  )
}
```

At this point your `LikesCounter` should look something like this:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ActionButton from './ActionButton'

class LikesCounter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      likes: props.initialLikes
    };
  }

  handleDislike() {
    alert('Dislike');
  }

  handleLike() {
    alert('Like');
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Likes: {this.state.likes}</div>
        <ActionButton
            text="Like +1"
            onClick={this.handleLike.bind(this)} />

        <ActionButton
            text="Dislike -1"
            onClick={this.handleDislike.bind(this)} />

      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default LikesCounter
```

Read more about why we're binding `this` [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html).

Open up the console and look at what information is available within the `<LikesCounter />` component.

Last step - hook up the buttons to change the state!

Let's modify our two our Like and Dislike functions to change our state. To modify our state, we pass in a new state object to `this.setState(newState)`


```jsx
handleLike() {
  this.setState({
    likes: this.state.likes + 1
  });
}

handleDislike() {
  this.setState({
    likes: this.state.likes - 1
  });
}
```

This is where the magic of React comes in. We are essentially throwing out the old information and replacing it with fresh, up-to-date information.

You can verify this state change by switching over to your browser and opening your React dev tools. Check out what happens when you click a button.

Good work!

Note: you may need to use `parseInt()` in order to update the state when you're handling updating the like count.

### Refactor

Our `handleDislike` and `handleLike` functions look very similar. Let's create a new function `modifyLikes` that takes a modification parameter and updates our states likes.

```jsx
  handleLikeClick () {
    this.modifyLikes(1);
  }

  handleDislikeClick () {
    this.modifyLikes(-1);
  }
```

## Going Further

If you're enjoying what we've seen so far with React, I'd highly recommend reading their section of documentation called [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

This article walks you through their best practices for approaching a new application using React. Since component-based / data down, actions up paradigms are fairly new to us, it'll be a worthy read for you.
