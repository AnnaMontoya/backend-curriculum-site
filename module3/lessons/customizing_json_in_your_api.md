## Learning Goals

* Generate and customize Rails Serializers
* Create JSON views using Jbuilder
* Compare the two tools

## Recap

### API Namespacing

- Why do we namespace?
- Why do we version?
- In routes
  - Default format of JSON
- In app folder  

## Warmup  
- What would be some situations where you don't want to expose, in json, all the information for a specific record?
- What tools/gems are out there to help you with this?
  - Split class 5min research Jbuilder/Active Model Serializer
  - Share out

## Lecture

### Customizing JSON output

When we call `render json:`, Rails makes a call to `as_json` under the hood unless we have a serializer set up. Eventually, `as_json` calls `to_json` and our response is generated.

Let's imagine that you don't just want the raw guts of your model converted to JSON and sent out to the user -- maybe you want to customize what you send back. There are a few approaches:

1. Try to use some clever combination of ERB and JSON in the view
2. Massage your model into some presentable hash in the controller
3. Override `as_json` on your model ([Example][as_json])
4. Use an ActiveModel serializer
5. Use Jbuilder (a DSL for creating JSON built into Rails 4/5) in the view layer

Let's take a look at the last two ways to customize the JSON that gets sent to the user.

## Setup

We're going to start where we left off in the internal API testing lesson.   

```
git clone https://github.com/s-espinosa/building_internal_apis.git  
bundle  
git checkout building_api_complete
git checkout -b setup  
```

We want to work with objects that have related models, so let's add an orders model:

```
rails g model order order_number
rails g model order_item order:references item:references item_price:integer quantity:integer
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Add Faker Gem
```
gem faker
bundle
```

Add relationships to your models:

```ruby
# in item.rb
has_many :order_items
has_many :orders, through: :order_items

# in order.rb
has_many :order_items
has_many :items, through: :order_items
```

And whip together a quick seed file:

```ruby
10.times do
  Item.create!(
    name: Faker::Commerce.product_name,
    description: Faker::ChuckNorris.fact,
  )
end

10.times do
  Order.create!(order_number: rand(100000..999999))
end

100.times do
  OrderItem.create!(
    item_id: rand(1..10),
    order_id: rand(1..10),
    item_price: rand(100..10000),
    quantity: rand(1..10)
  )
end
```

And seed

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

Create your controller

  - `rails g controller api/v1/orders index show`
  - Update routes.
  - Set `index` and `show` methods to render appropriate json

## Responses

> What's he building in there? -Tom Waits

What does our JSON currently output as?

What do we want out JSON to output?  

JSON responses should contain the following keys from the following endpoints:

**api/v1/items**

```javascript
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Hammer",
    "description": "Chuck Norris fact"
  },
  {...}
]
```

**api/v1/items/:id**

```javascript
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Hammer",
  "description": "Chuck Norris fact"
  "num_orders": 5,
  "orders": [
    {"order_number": "12345ABC"},
    {...}
  ]
}
```

**api/v1/orders**

```javascript
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "order_number": "12345ABC",
  },
  {...}
]
```

**api/v1/orders/:id**

```javascript
{
  "id": 1,
  "order_number": "12345ABC",
  "num_items": 5,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1
      "name": "Hammer",
      "price": 11
    },
    {...}
  ]
}
```

## Using ActiveModel Serializers to modify `as_json`

[Active Model Serializer Docs][am_serializer_guide]

[am_serializer_guide]: https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/tree/master/docs

### Intro

- Install with a gem: `gem 'active_model_serializers', '~> 0.10.0'`
- Uses model syntax
- Modifies [`.as_json`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON.html#method-i-as_json), which happens in the background of [`respond_with`](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Responder.html)
- Serializers describe which attributes and relationships should be serialized.

### Code Along

We're going to create a serializer for `Order`.

First, let's checkout a new branch called `json_serializers`.

- Create your serializer
  - `rails g serializer order`

- Add a few attributes
  - Some existing fields
    - `id`, `order_number`
  - Some custom fields
    - `num_items`
  - A relationship
    - `items`

Our final product should look something like this:

```ruby
# controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render json: Order.all
  end

  def show
    render json: Order.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

```ruby
# serializers/order_serializer.rb
class OrderSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :order_number, :num_items

  has_many :items

  def num_items
    object.items.count
  end
end
```

### Lab

Do what I did to `Order`, but on `Item` now.

- Some existing fields
  - `id`, `name`, `description`
- Some custom fields
  - `num_orders`
- A relationship
  - `orders`

## Using jbuilder to build JSON views

[jbuilder docs][jbuilder_readme]

[jbuilder_readme]: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder/blob/master/README.md

### Intro

- Built in to Rails 4+ (still needs to be gem installed)
- Uses Rails views
- What does DSL mean?

### Code Along

Let's use Jbuilder to create JSON views for `Order`.

First, add and commit your serializers work, go back to the `setup` branch and checkout a `jbuilder` branch.

- Uncomment `gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.5'` in the Gemfile


- Add views
  - (/views/api/v1/orders)

- Add attributes
  - Some existing fields
    - `id`, `order_number`
  - Some custom fields
    - `num_items`
  - A relationship
    - `items`

Our final product should look something like this:

```ruby
# controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @orders = Order.all
  end

  def show
    @order = Order.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

```ruby
# views/api/v1/orders/index.json.jbuilder
json.(@orders) do |order|
  json.(order, :id, :order_number)
  json.num_items(order.items.count)
end
```

```ruby
# views/api/v1/orders/show.json.jbuilder
json.(@order, :id, :order_number)
json.num_items(@order.items.count)
json.items @order.items do |item|
  json.(item, :id)
end
```

To see this, make sure the endpoint you make a `GET` request to is post-pended with `.json`.

For example, `localhost:3000/api/v1/orders.json`

### Lab

Do what I did to `Order`, but on `Item` now.

- Some existing fields
  - `id`, `name`, `description`
- Some custom fields
  - `num_orders`
- A relationship
  - `orders`
